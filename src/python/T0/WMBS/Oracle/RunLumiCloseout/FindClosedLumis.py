_FindClosedLumis_

Oracle implementation of FindClosedLumis

Checking for closed run/stream/lumi with lumis above
a minimum threshold, extracting filecounts as well.

A lumi is considered closed if we have EoLS records
from every SM instance OR if we have EoLS records
from every SM instance except the ones that are not
supposed to have EoLS records anymore (because
the instance already has a EoR record with a max
lumi that is smaller than the current lumi).

Return a list of dictionaries with run/stream/lumi.
